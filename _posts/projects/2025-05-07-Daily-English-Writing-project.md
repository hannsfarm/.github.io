### Why I Started My Daily English Writing Project

About 50 million people speak Korean. By contrast, billions speak English.

Just by the numbers, learning English gives me a much better chance of finding people who truly relate to my work.

That’s why I decided to start writing in English every day — to get better at it.

Of course, I’ll write plenty of awkward sentences  (maybe even this one.)

Still, if I keep writing, my English will improve — and maybe I’ll start reaching people who really care about my work.

And someday, if even a few lines give someone a bit of inspiration, that’s enough for me.

### How I’ll track my progress

I started this project on May 4, 2025. At that time, my EF SET 50 score was 36 (A2 level). I'll write in English every day until the end of the year, then take the test again to see how much I've improved.
