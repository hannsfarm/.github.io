Creators often think: “If I study more, the results will be better.”

But this mindset might not be so helpful. It’s not really about aiming for perfection — it’s often about avoiding the fear of failure or uncertainty.

So don’t waste too much time trying to prepare everything perfectly. Instead, create something quickly, launch it, promote it, and optimize it.

To make something better, it’s usually more helpful to create often and improve through repetition.
