description: A piece about working like a farmer—doing the day’s work without chasing results or trying to prove anything.

A long time ago, almost everyone was a farmer.
The farmer’s reason for working was simple: to survive.
But now, most people work in offices. We don’t grow our own food anymore.

So today, survival and work are less connected.
These days, we work out of jealousy or competition—
to impress others, or to show off a “successful” life.

Maybe it’s time to go back to the basics.
Work like a farmer.
Just plant the seeds, and wait—
don’t worry whether they grow perfectly or not.

You’ll feel less pressure—and more satisfaction.
